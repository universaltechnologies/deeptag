# IllusionRP

Unity high-definition graphics plugin for Universal Render Pipelines.

<img src="./Documentation~/images/banner.png">

</div>

# Highlights

- High-quality graphics features with one-click integration for your URP project
- Ready-to-use shaders and templates for Amplify Shader Editor
- Compatible with Unity 2022, 2023, and Unity 6 versions

# Demo

<b>Sponza Demo</b> 

IllusionRP demo for Sponza scene, see [AkiKurisu/IllusionRP-Demo](https://github.com/AkiKurisu/IllusionRP-Demo) for more details.

![Demo](https://github.com/AkiKurisu/IllusionRP-Demo/raw/master/Documentation/images/sponza.png)

<b>AIChara Remaster Demo</b> 

IllusionRP is first designed to re-rendering game characters of @ILLUSION.

Demo is WIP, stay tuned.

![Showcase](./Documentation~/images/showcase.png)

# Notice

Designed for <b>Forward</b> and <b>Forward+</b> rendering path, <b>Deferred</b> rendering path is not supported.

> Add new shading model in deferred rendering path need modify the URP source code, which is hard to maintain. While using forward rendering path, we can add shaders without limitations.

# Platforms

- Android (Vulkan)

- Standalone Windows (DX12)

# Version

[Unity 6](https://github.com/AkiKurisu/IllusionRP/tree/master)

- Unity 6.3 (URP 17.3.0)

[Unity 2022 and Unity 2023](https://github.com/AkiKurisu/IllusionRP/tree/urp14)

- Unity 2022.3.62f1 (URP 14.0.12)

- Unity 2023.2.22f1 (URP 16.0.6)

# Install

Use git URL to download package by Unity Package Manager ```https://github.com/AkiKurisu/IllusionRP.git```.

To fix compute shader compilation error when enable `Forward+`, copy the `./com.unity.render-pipelines.ps5~` folder to your project `Package` directory and rename it to `com.unity.render-pipelines.ps5`. 

# Setup
1. Replace Post Process Data with `IllusionRPPostProcessData` in your URP renderer asset.
    ![Post Process Data](./Documentation~/images/post_process_data.png)
2. Add `Illusion Graphics` renderer feature in your URP renderer asset.
    ![Renderer Feature](./Documentation~/images/renderer_feature.png)

>[!Tip]
> For best visual experience and performance, I recommend you to enable `Depth Priming` and `Forward+` in renderer asset to use <b>Pre-Z Cluster Forward Rendering</b>.

# Features

Introduction to included rendering features.

## Skin

Support <b>Screen Space Subsurface Scattering (SSSSS)</b> ported from HDRP and fallback to <b>Spherical Gaussian Subsurface Scattering (SGSSS)</b> introduced by [Matt - Approximating Subsurface Scattering With Spherical Gaussians](https://therealmjp.github.io/posts/sss-sg/) when screen space sss is disabled.

<b>Dual Lobe Specular</b> provides a more natural skin effect.

![SSS](./Documentation~/images/sss.png)

## Hair

Support <b>Kajiya-Kay</b> shading model with better performance.

Support <b>Marschner</b> shading model implemented by Unreal Engine.

![Hair Shading](./Documentation~/images/hair_shading.png)

<b>Multipass</b> is used (opaque & transparent).

<b>OIT</b> to solve hair transparent rendering order based on NVIDIA's [Weighted Blended Order-Independent Transparency](https://jcgt.org/published/0002/02/09/).
  
## Fabric

Support <b>Anisotropy Specular</b>.

![Anisotropy](./Documentation~/images/anisotropy.png)

<b>Oren-Nayar</b> diffuse model.
  
<b>Sheen Scattering</b> with <b>Ashikhmin</b> (smooth) and <b>Charlie</b> (softer) model.

## Hybrid Lit

The upgraded version of `Universal Render Pipeline/Lit` shader.

Support <b>PreIntegrated Imaged Based Lighting</b> ported from HDRP.

Support all <b>Screen Space Lighting</b> features in IllusionRP.

Support <b>Order Independent Transparency</b>.

![Hybrid Lit](./Documentation~/images/hybrid_lit.png)

> [!TIP]
> You can directly replace the urp lit shader with `Universal Render Pipeline/Hybrid Lit` shader to get better lighting results.

## Water

Water shader is modified from URP samples and has been converted to ASE version.

> [!TIP]
> To sample full scene color instead of `_CameraOpaqueTexture`, you need enable `requireHistoryColor` or `ScreenSpaceReflection` in `Illusion Graphics` renderer feature.

## Shadows

Support <b>Per-Object Shadow</b> based on [stalomeow/StarRailNPRShader](https://github.com/stalomeow/StarRailNPRShader) to enhance character shadow quality.

Include <b>Contact Shadows</b> ported from HDRP to capture small details.

![Contact Shadows](./Documentation~/images/contact_shadows.png)

Support <b>Micro Shadows</b> ported from HDRP to simulate small details embedded in the Material of a GameObject, but not in its Mesh geometry.

Support <b>Fragment Shadow Bias</b> to reduce shadow acne.

> [!Warning]
> Enable Fragment Shadow Bias will let IllusionRP shaders not compatiable with URP's built-in shader since we now apply shadow bias in receiver fragement shader instead of in caster vertex shader.

Include <b>Percentage-Closer Soft Shadow</b> from [recaeee/RecaNoMaho_P](https://github.com/recaeee/RecaNoMaho_P) for more realistic shadows.

![PCSS](./Documentation~/images/pcss.png)

> [!TIP]
> Percentage-Closer Soft Shadow only works for Main Light Shadow Caster and Per-Object Shadow Caster.

## Ambient Occlusion

Include <b>Ground Truth Ambient Occlusion</b> based on [bladesero/GTAO_URP](https://github.com/bladesero/GTAO_URP) and HDRP implementation.

Support <b>AO Multi-Bounce</b> and <b>Separate AO</b> for diffuse and specular lighting.

![GTAO](./Documentation~/images/gtao.png)

## Global Illumination

Include <b>Screen Space Reflection</b> based on [EricHu33/URP_SSR](https://github.com/EricHu33/URP_SSR) and HDRP implementation.

![SSR](./Documentation~/images/ssr.png)

Support 3 algorithms: <b>View Space Linear Search</b>, <b>Screen Space Linear Search</b> and <b>Hiz Search</b>.

Include <b>Precomputed Radiance Transfer Global Illumination (PRTGI)</b> based on [AKGWSB/CasualPRT](https://github.com/AKGWSB/CasualPRT).

![PRTGI](./Documentation~/images/prtgi.png)

> [!TIP]
> `PRTGI` will not affect materials that use baked lightmaps.

Support <b>Reflection Probe Normalization</b> based on Unity Adaptive Probe Volume when enable PRTGI to prevent light leaking.

![Reflection Probe Normalization](./Documentation~/images/reflection_normalization.png)

Include <b>Screen Space Global Illumination</b> based on [jiaozi158/UnitySSGIURP](https://github.com/jiaozi158/UnitySSGIURP) and HDRP implementation.

![SSGI](./Documentation~/images/ssgi.png)

> [!TIP]
> Recommend to use `PRTGI` outdoor and combine with `SSGI` indoor. 
> 
> Also, `SSGI` will not affect materials that use baked lightmaps.

![SSGI + PRTGI](./Documentation~/images/gi_combine.png)

## Post Processing

Include <b>Automatic Exposure</b> ported from HDRP.

![Exposure](./Documentation~/images/exposure.png)

Include <b>Convolution Bloom</b> from [StellarWarp/High-Performance-Convolution-Bloom-On-Unity](https://github.com/StellarWarp/High-Performance-Convolution-Bloom-On-Unity). 

![Bloom](./Documentation~/images/bloom.png)

Include <b>Volumetric Light</b> from [CristianQiu/Unity-URP-Volumetric-Light](https://github.com/CristianQiu/Unity-URP-Volumetric-Light).

![Volumetric Light](./Documentation~/images/volumetric_light.png)

Include <b>Advanced Tonemapping</b> with two kinds: 

<b>Gran-Turismo</b> from [yaoling1997/GT-ToneMapping](https://github.com/yaoling1997/GT-ToneMapping) better for anime characters.

<b>Filmic ACES</b> from Unreal Engine which is more artist friendly.

![Tonemapping](./Documentation~/images/tonemapping.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Advanced Tonemapping only works in `High Dynamic Range` grading mode.

# Debugging

Recommended to install [Chris](https://github.com/AkiKurisu/Chris) to use Unreal-like console variables for debugging rendering features.

> Install from git url `https://github.com/AkiKurisu/Chris`

![Console Variable](./Documentation~/images/console_variables.png)

`Chris` also provides a Data-Driven Dynamic Volume Provider to support configuring volume profile per-platform.

![Dynamic Volume](./Documentation~/images/dynamic_volume.png)
