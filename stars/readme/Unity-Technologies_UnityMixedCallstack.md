# Unity Mixed Callstack Visual Studio Plugin

> [!NOTE]
> This fork of PmipMyCallstack has been developed for developers at Unity and support has been added to [our clone of Mono](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/mono).

## Summary

UnityMixedCallstack is a Visual Studio 2015/2017/2019/2022 extension to help debug Unity native code. Mono doesn't generate debug symbols that Visual Studio understands for JITted functions. As a result, Visual Studio cannot show anything meaningful for managed stack frames. The resulting call stack is confusing: native functions are mixed with what appear to be random numbers, which can only be translated into managed functions one at a time with the `mono_pmip` function. This plugin translates these managed addresses into descriptive stack frames for you when you use the 4.6 Mono runtime.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin does have an effect on performance when enabled via diagnostic switch, as it records the address of each function as they get JITted. This is most noticeable on startup and when first entering Play mode.

## Get started

### Prerequisites
    
* You must be using the 4.6 Mono Runtime.
* Only available for Unity 2018.2 and later.
* Older versions of Visual Studio require an older version of the plugin. Version 2.6.1 was the last version with working support for Visual Studio 2019.

### Build from source

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to install the [Visual Studio SDK](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt683786.aspx).

To ensure you are using the latest version of the plugin, you can build from source. To build from source, clone this repository with Git and open the UnityMixedCallstack solution. Simply select **Release** and build like you would any other Visual Studio file. You'll find the installation files in `bin/Release`. 

### Download precompiled

A precompiled plugin can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/UnityMixedCallstack/releases).

### Install the plugin

To install the plugin, double click UnityMixedCallStack.vsix (open with Visual Studio version selector) which will open the VSIX installer. Then select the Visual Studio versions you want to install the plugin to and hit install. You'll need to close all instances of Visual Studio before you install.

### Enable the plugin in Unity

The plugin can be enabled via a diagnostic switch in the Editor.

Select **Edit > Preferences** to open the Unity Preferences window. Select the **Diagnostics** tab on the left, and then select the dropdown next to the **MixedCallstackDebuggingLevel** option (see image below). There are three options, **Off**, **Legacy** and **LineNumbers**. Select **LineNumbers** as **Legacy** will only display the function name in the mixed callstack whereas **LineNumbers** will also provide the line numbers. You'll need to restart the Editor after setting this option in order for it to take effect.

> [!NOTE]
> On newer Unity versions (2023) the diagnostics switches are grouped into sub-sections and the setting can be found in the **Core** section.

### Disable the **Enable Just My Code** setting in Visual Studio

Make sure that the **Tools > Options > Debugging > Enable Just My Code** option is disabled. Otherwise the callstack will display the managed frames as a single frame label `[External Code]`.

### Use the 4.6 Mono Runtime

> [!NOTE]
> This does not seem to be needed anymore on recent versions of Unity (2023)

This plugin will only emit managed stack frames when using the 4.6 mono runtime in your Unity project. To set this, go to **Edit > Project Settings > Player** and change the **Scripting Runtime Version** value to **Experimental (.NET 4.6 Equivalent)**. You will be asked to restart the Editor, after which the project will open with the new runtime. To force the Editor to use the 4.6 runtime, you can launch the Editor with the arguments `-scripting-runtime-version Latest`

## Credits and technical details

Michael DeRoy wrote this plug with help from Jonathan Chambers; it was forked off of JB Evain (VSTU)'s PMIPMyCallstack plugin, which would call mono_pmip from Visual Studio on each managed frame. The original plugin worked well for small programs, but due to the high number of inter process function calls per frame Unity would lag at every breakpoint and hang for minutes if the threads window was opened. This new plugin relies on the mono runtime to write out the address of each managed function as they are JITted.

This gets output into `AppData/Local/Temp` as a `pmip_<processid>_<numdomainreload>` file. These files are created in such a way that they will automatically delete themselves when no one holds a handle to them, so don't worry about files building up! `numdomainreload` is a number that increments every domain reload (since we reJIT functions). The file is formatted like below. Following a plugin version line (to deal with possible future updates), each line shows the start and end address of the managed function, followed by a delimiter, followed by a string to be displayed in Visual Studio:

```

The Visual Studio plugin itself is fairly simple. We open a filestream on the pmip file, and as we read it we load the items into a `List` sorted by function address. If domain reload is triggered, the list is invalidated, and we open the most recent pmip file mono produced. We implement a `FilterNextFrame` function that Visual Studio will call back into when hitting a breakpoint. The plugin will then analyze each frame, and for managed frames it will check that the address of the function is in our sorted list via a fuzzy binary search. If the function is found, instead of writing the address of the function out, we write out the description of the function that we found.

## Advanced options

The diagnostic switch has not been configured to enable the plugin when you build standalone players. To use **UnityMixedCallstack** with players you need to set the environment variable `UNITY_MIXED_CALLSTACK` to enable the plugin. For details on how to do that see "How to use UnityMixedCallstack with Players" below.

> [!WARNING]
> **DO NOT SET `UNITY_MIXED_CALLSTACK` GLOBALLY** as this will activate the plugin for every Mono used in Unity **including the ones used to build Unity**, so unless you want your next build to take hours **do not do this** in the same shells you're building in.

### How to use UnityMixedCallstack with Players

To use UnityMixedCallstack with players one can follow the following instructions (in addition to the standard instructions above):
1. First open the Editor-project in Visual Studio (either using **unity\Projects\VisualStudioAllTargets-unity.sln** or **unity\Projects\Editor-unity.sln**). 
2. Then, in **Visual Studio** in the **Solution Explorer** right-click the **EditorApp** and select **Properties** (see image below for reference)

3. Now, in the category **Debugger->Environment** add the following variable `UNITY_MIXED_CALLSTACK=1` and hit **Apply**. (see image below)
![Image of Visual Studio setting path](Images/envSettingsStep2.png)
4. Once this is done, open a new command terminal.
5. In the command terminal run `set UNITY_GIVE_CHANCE_TO_ATTACH_DEBUGGER=1`. This option will give you the option to attach a native debugger when you run the player executable.
6. Now, in the same terminal run the executable via `[path to executable]/[name of player].exe`
7. You will now be prompted to attach with a native debugger (see image below)
![Image of Visual Studio setting path](Images/attach.png)
8. When the prompt pops up, navigate to **Visual Studio** where you have the Editor project opened (with the correct settings from above), then click **Debug->Attach To Process**.
9. In the list select the player you wish to debug (it should have the same name as in step 6 above).
10. Hit attach,  then return to the natuve debugger prompt from step 7 and hit OK.
11. You are now attached to the standalone player with a native debugger and should see the full callstack, including the mono instructions.

These steps should be enough to see the full callstacks in a Unity Standalone Player!
