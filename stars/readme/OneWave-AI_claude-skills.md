# Claude Skills Library

## Featured: /agent-army

Deploy 3 to 50+ independent Claude agents in parallel, each with its own 1M token context window. Each agent spawns sub-agents underneath. The system runs in waves -- execute, audit, propagate -- and checks its own work between each.

Built for tasks where one agent isn't enough: large refactors, full-site audits, bulk content generation, codebase migrations. Battle-tested on 60+ concurrent agents in a single session.

## Skill Format

Every skill is a single `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: What the skill does and when to use it.
tools: Read, Write, Bash, Agent
model: inherit
---

# Skill prompt content here...
```

Claude Code loads this as a system prompt when the skill is invoked. The `tools` field declares which Claude Code tools the skill needs access to.
