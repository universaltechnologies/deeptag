## About Us

We are **RoboParty**, founded on February 21, 2025. We started developing humanoid robots in April and completed the prototype **ROBOTO_ORIGIN** in just four months. We have always upheld the philosophy of open source. ROBOTO_ORIGIN's entire R&D process, including all structures, electronics, training, and deployment, has been open-sourced.

As we advance the development of new robots, we realize that a high-performance robot cannot be achieved through DIY alone. Therefore, we have decided to officially open-source this running and jumping prototype to document our journey.

> This robot can be completely assembled through Taobao procurement and Jialichuang prototyping. It can be truly assembled independently through DIY. With our open-source training and deployment code, you can easily achieve walking and running.

In the future, we will gradually add the motion control algorithms implemented on this robot to the open-source repository. However, as a fully open-source robot, its functionality can be defined by the vast number of developers and users, so a creative workshop will also be launched soon.
