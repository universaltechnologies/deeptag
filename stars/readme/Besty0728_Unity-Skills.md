> The current official maintenance baseline is **Unity 2022.3+**. Some Unity 2021 compatibility logic may still remain in the codebase, but future feature work, regression testing, and adaptation will focus on **2022.3+ / Unity 6**.

## 🤝 Acknowledgments
This project is a deep refactoring and feature extension based on the excellent concept of [unity-mcp](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp).

## 🚀 Core Features

- 🛠️ **543 REST Skills Comprehensive Toolkit**: Includes 13 advisory design modules with Batch operations for multi-object control.
- 🎛️ **Dual-Mode Flexibility**: Switch between Semi-Auto (code-first) and Full-Auto (direct manipulation) for different workflows.
- 🤖 **4 Major IDEs Native Support**: Claude Code / Antigravity / Gemini CLI / Codex — one-click install and use.
- 🛡️ **Transactional Atomicity**: Failed operations auto-rollback, leaving scenes clean and safe.
- 🌍 **Multi-Instance Simultaneous Control**: Automatic port discovery and global registry for controlling multiple Unity projects at once.
- 🔗 **Ultra-Stable Long Connections**: Configurable request timeout (default 15 minutes), automatic recovery after Domain Reload, with retry hints during script compilation/asset updates.
- 🛡️ **Anti-Hallucination Guardrails**: Each Skill module includes DO NOT lists and routing rules to prevent calls to nonexistent commands or parameter errors.

## 🎛️ Operating Modes

| Mode | Default | Available Skills | Use Case |
|:-----|:-------:|:----------------:|:---------|
| **Semi-Auto** | ✅ | ~80 | AI writes C# code + light Skills assist (script, perception, scene, editor, asset, workflow, debug) |
| **Full-Auto** | — | All 543 | AI directly manipulates Unity (create objects, configure materials/lights/UI, build scenes) |

**How to switch**:
- → Full-Auto: `"full auto"` / `"full-auto mode"` / `"build the scene for me"` / `"directly manipulate Unity"`
- → Semi-Auto: `"semi-auto"` / `"code-first"` — each new session defaults to Semi-Auto

> 13 advisory design modules (architecture, performance, design patterns, testability, etc.) are available in both modes and loaded on demand.

## 🏗️ Quick Install Supported IDE/Terminals

This project has been deeply optimized for the following environments to ensure a continuous and stable development experience (tools not listed below are not necessarily unsupported — they just lack a quick installer; use ***Custom Installation*** to the corresponding directory):

| AI Terminal | Support Status | Special Features |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Antigravity** | ✅ Supported | Supports `/unity-skills` slash commands with native workflow integration. |
| **Claude Code** | ✅ Supported | Intelligent Skill intent recognition, supports complex multi-step automation. |
| **Gemini CLI** | ✅ Supported | Experimental support, adapted to the latest `experimental.skills` specification. |
| **Codex** | ✅ Supported | Supports `$skill` explicit invocation and implicit intent recognition. |

## 🏁 Quick Start

> **Overview**: Install Unity Plugin → Start UnitySkills Server → AI Uses Skills

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/installation-demo.gif" alt="一键安装演示" width="800">
</p>

### 1. Install Unity Plugin
Add via Unity Package Manager using Git URL:

**Stable Version (main)**:
```
https://github.com/Besty0728/Unity-Skills.git?path=/SkillsForUnity
```

**Beta Version (beta)**:
```
https://github.com/Besty0728/Unity-Skills.git?path=/SkillsForUnity#beta
```

**Specific Version** (e.g., v1.6.0):
```
https://github.com/Besty0728/Unity-Skills.git?path=/SkillsForUnity#v1.6.0
```

> 📦 All version packages are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/Besty0728/Unity-Skills/releases) page

### 2. Start Server
In Unity, click menu: `Window > UnitySkills > Start Server`

> ⏳ `script_*`, `debug_force_recompile`, `debug_set_defines`, some asset reimports, and package changes may trigger compilation or Domain Reload. Temporary REST unavailability during that window is expected; wait a moment and retry.

### 3. One-Click AI Skills Configuration
1. Open `Window > UnitySkills > Skill Installer`.
2. Select the corresponding terminal icon (Claude / Antigravity / Gemini / Codex).
3. Click **"Install"** to complete the environment configuration without manual code copying.

> The installer copies the `unity-skills~/` template directory from the package to the target location.
>
> Installer output files (generated in target directory):
> - `SKILL.md`
> - `skills/`
> - `references/`
> - `scripts/unity_skills.py`
> - `scripts/agent_config.json` (contains Agent identifier)
> - Antigravity additionally generates `workflows/unity-skills.md`

> **Codex Note**: **Global installation** is recommended. Project-level installation requires declaration in `AGENTS.md` to be recognized; after global installation, restart Codex to use.

<summary><h3>4. Manual Skills Installation (Optional)</h3></summary>

If one-click installation is not supported or preferred, follow this **standard procedure** for manual deployment (applicable to all tools supporting Skills):

#### ✅ Standard Installation Method A
1. **Custom Installation**: In the installation interface, select the "Custom Path" option to install Skills to any directory you specify (e.g., `Assets/MyTools/AI`) for easier project management.

#### ✅ Standard Installation Method B
1. **Locate Skills Source Directory**: The `SkillsForUnity/unity-skills~/` directory in the UPM package is the distributable Skills template (root directory contains `SKILL.md`).
2. **Find the Tool's Skills Root Directory**: Different tools have different paths; refer to the tool's documentation first.
3. **Copy Completely**: Copy the entire contents of `unity-skills~/` to the tool's Skills root directory (rename to `unity-skills/`).
4. **Create agent_config.json**: Create an `agent_config.json` file in the `unity-skills/scripts/` directory:
   ```json
   {"agentId": "your-agent-name", "installedAt": "2026-02-11T00:00:00Z"}
   ```
   Replace `your-agent-name` with the name of your AI tool (e.g., `claude-code`, `antigravity`, `gemini-cli`, `codex`).
5. **Directory Structure Requirements**: After copying, maintain the structure as follows (example):
   - `unity-skills/SKILL.md`
   - `unity-skills/skills/`
   - `unity-skills/references/`
   - `unity-skills/scripts/unity_skills.py`
   - `unity-skills/scripts/agent_config.json`
6. **Restart the Tool**: Let the tool reload the Skills list.
7. **Verify Loading**: Trigger the Skills list/command in the tool (or execute a simple skill call) to confirm availability.

#### 🔎 Common Tool Directory Reference
The following are verified default directories (if the tool has a custom path configured, use that instead):

- Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/`
- Antigravity: `~/.agent/skills/`
- Gemini CLI: `~/.gemini/skills/`
- OpenAI Codex: `~/.codex/skills/`

#### 🧩 Other Tools Supporting Skills
If you're using other tools that support Skills, install according to the Skills root directory specified in that tool's documentation. As long as the **standard installation specification** is met (root directory contains `SKILL.md` and maintains `skills/`, `references/`, and `scripts/` structure), it will be correctly recognized.
