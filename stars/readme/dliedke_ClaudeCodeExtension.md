- **Codex**: Exits the agent and runs `npm install -g @openai/codex@latest` inside WSL
- **Cursor Agent (Windows)**: Exits the agent and runs `agent update`
- **Cursor Agent (WSL)**: Exits the agent and runs `cursor-agent update` inside WSL
- **Open Code**: Exits the agent and runs `npm i -g opencode-ai`
- **Windsurf (WSL)**: Exits the agent and runs `devin update` inside WSL

Click the update button and the extension will handle the update process. Agents use the appropriate exit methods before updating (exit command for most, double CTRL+C for Codex).

## Version History

### Version 10.12
- **Qwen Code provider removed**: Qwen Code is no longer bundled as a provider option. The `AiProvider` enum now uses explicit ordinals and skips `6` (the retired `QwenCode` value) so existing user settings that still reference it fall back to `ClaudeCode` cleanly via a defensive `Enum.IsDefined` guard in `LoadSettings`. Menu entry, availability detection, install instructions, Enter-key branch, workspace-change handler, detach label, and update flow for Qwen Code have all been removed.
- **Terminal row minimum reduced to 20px**: The MainGrid terminal row `MinHeight` dropped from 60px to 20px (both normal and inverted layouts), allowing the splitter to travel further down so the prompt area can grow larger.

### Version 10.11
- **Cursor Agent: Yolo Mode menu option**: Added "Cursor Agent: Yolo Mode" toggle in the model context menu. When enabled, Cursor Agent (Windows native) and Cursor Agent (WSL) start with `--yolo` to skip all approvals, mirroring the Claude Code skip-permissions and Codex approval-never toggles. Setting persists as `CursorAgentAutoRun` and triggers an immediate terminal restart so the flag takes effect.
- **Splitter reach & boundary fix**: Prompt section now has a live `MaxHeight` cap tied to the control's rendered height minus the splitter and the bottom row's `MinHeight`. Previously, dragging the splitter down (or loading a large saved `SplitterPosition` into a smaller tool window) could push the splitter handle and terminal entirely out of view. Also lowered the terminal row `MinHeight` from 150px to 60px so the splitter can travel further down and the prompt area can grow larger.

### Version 10.10
- **Install Caveman menu option**: Added "Install Caveman" entry in the model menu (after "Set Language") for Claude Code and Claude Code (WSL). Triggers `/plugin marketplace add JuliusBrussee/caveman`, `/plugin install caveman@caveman`, `/reload-plugins`, and `/caveman` inside the running Claude session to install the [Caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman) ultra-compressed communication plugin.

### Version 10.8
- **Test deployment automation**: Internal release used to validate the new automated marketplace publishing script (`publish.cmd` + `publishManifest.json`), which performs a clean Release rebuild and pushes the VSIX to the Visual Studio Marketplace via `VsixPublisher.exe`. No user-facing changes.

### Version 10.7
- **Detect winget-installed Claude Code**: Provider detection and command launch now use `where claude` (PATHEXT-aware) instead of only `claude.cmd`, so `claude.exe` installed via winget (or any other installer) is recognized without showing the installation pop-up. Fixes [#30](https://github.com/dliedke/ClaudeCodeExtension/issues/30).
- **Fix `claude: command not found` in WSL terminal**: WSL terminal launches now use `bash -lic` (login + interactive) instead of `bash -ic`, so `.profile`/`.bash_profile` PATH entries are loaded. Applies to Claude Code (WSL), Codex (WSL), Cursor Agent (WSL) and Windsurf (WSL). Fixes the follow-up issue on [#27](https://github.com/dliedke/ClaudeCodeExtension/issues/27).

### Version 10.6
- **Invert Layout option**: Added option to swap the prompt and terminal positions, placing the terminal on top and the prompt area on the bottom. Toggle via the settings menu (gear icon) > "Invert Layout".

### Version 10.5
- **Fix WSL provider detection false negatives**: Fixed repeated "installation" pop-ups for WSL providers by switching to login shell (`bash -lc`), increasing detection timeouts (8s/20s), and fixing retry logic that was aborting on harmless shell warnings.
- **Fix floating terminal window**: Added retry logic for terminal window discovery (5s + 10s) and `SetParent()` embedding (up to 3 attempts with Win32 error logging), preventing the terminal from appearing as a separate floating window on busy systems.

### Version 10.4
- **Windsurf model selection**: Added model selection menu for Windsurf provider (Claude Opus, Claude Sonnet, Codex, Gemini Pro) with `/model` command sent directly to the terminal.
- **Windsurf Show Usage**: Added "Show Usage" menu item for Windsurf that opens https://windsurf.com/subscription/usage in the browser.

### Version 10.3
- **Added Windsurf (WSL) provider**: Full support for Windsurf (devin CLI) running inside WSL with automatic detection, installation instructions, one-click update (`devin update`), and optional `--permission-mode dangerous` flag.

### Version 10.2
- **Fix CMake project directory detection**: Fixed workspace directory detection for CMake and "Open Folder" projects that don't use `.sln` files. Previously the terminal would launch in the parent directory; now it correctly detects folder-based projects.
- **Added Awesome Codex CLI badge**: Added "Mentioned in Awesome Codex CLI" badge to README.

### Version 10.1
- **Send editor selection to prompt**: New toolbar button (📋) grabs the currently selected code from the active editor and inserts it as a formatted snippet (with file path, line numbers, and syntax-highlighted code fence) into the prompt text box. Also available via right-click context menu "Send Selection to Claude Code" in the editor.

### Version 10.0
- **Icon-based toolbar**: Replaced text buttons (Send, Add File, Changes, Restart) with compact emoji icons (▶, 📎, 🔀, ⟳) for a cleaner, more uniform toolbar. All buttons now use consistent icon styling with tooltips.
- **Softer UI text**: Labels ("Prompt / Paste Image", "Send with Enter", terminal header) and icon buttons use slightly reduced opacity for a softer, less harsh appearance in dark theme.
- **Fix detach icon on theme switch**: The detach/attach button icon now correctly updates its color when switching between dark and light VS themes.

### Version 9.7
- **Fix button color consistency**: All toolbar buttons now use the same theme-aware text color. Previously, icon buttons (model selector, settings gear, detach) used hardcoded gray text instead of matching the VS theme color like the other buttons.

### Version 9.6
- **UI improvement**: Moved file attachment chips to the "Send with Enter" row, freeing up space in the button toolbar and reducing clutter.
- **Removed file attachment limit**: Previously capped at 5 files; now unlimited files can be attached to a prompt.

### Version 9.5
- **Fix image/file not found by AI**: Consolidated temp file storage into a single `ClaudeCodeVS_Session` folder. Previously, pasted images and per-prompt file copies used separate root folders (`ClaudeCodeVS_Session` and `ClaudeCodeVS`), which caused the AI to sometimes fail to locate attached files.

### Version 9.4
- **Fix text selection blocking prompt**: When a user has selected text in the Command Prompt terminal, the prompt paste would fail. Now sends an extra right-click before pasting to clear any active text selection.

### Version 9.3
- **Change Account**: Added "Change Account" option in the Claude model menu. Sends `/logout`, prompts the user to switch accounts in the browser, then resumes Claude Code with `claude --resume` (respects `--dangerously-skip-permissions` setting).

### Version 9.2
- **Terminal hidden from taskbar**: The embedded terminal window (Command Prompt or Windows Terminal) no longer appears as a separate entry in the Windows taskbar, keeping the taskbar clean.
- **Terminal layout refresh on solution load**: When opening or closing a solution, the embedded terminal now receives deferred resize/repaint passes to fix visual corruption caused by VS re-layout during solution transitions. Works with both Command Prompt and Windows Terminal.

### Version 9.1
- **Windows Terminal installation instructions**: Added `winget install --id Microsoft.WindowsTerminal -e` command to the "Windows Terminal Not Found" dialog and to the README installation section.

### Version 9.0
- **F5/Ctrl+F5/Shift+F5 forwarding from terminal to VS**: When the embedded terminal has keyboard focus, F5 (Start Debugging), Ctrl+F5 (Start Without Debugging), and Shift+F5 (Stop Debugging) are now intercepted and forwarded to Visual Studio as debug commands instead of being consumed by the terminal. Works with both attached and detached terminal windows.

### Version 8.9
- **Extension icon on tool window tabs**: The extension icon (app.ico) is now displayed on all tool window tabs (main window and detached terminal) for easier identification

### Version 8.8
- **Auto-focus detached terminal on extension focus**: When the terminal is detached to a separate tab and the main extension panel regains focus, the detached terminal tab is automatically activated so the user can see the AI output alongside the prompt area

### Version 8.7
- **Performance: Non-blocking solution/project open**: Changed `SolutionEventsHandler` from synchronous `JoinableTaskFactory.Run` to fire-and-forget `RunAsync`, eliminating VS hangs when opening solutions/projects (provider detection + terminal startup no longer block the UI thread)
- **Performance: Fast process tree termination**: Replaced WMI-based `KillProcessAndChildren` (1-5 seconds per query) with ToolHelp32 kernel snapshots (sub-millisecond), dramatically speeding up terminal shutdown and VS exit
- **Performance: Background process cleanup on shutdown**: `CleanupResources` now offloads process tree termination and temp directory deletion to a background thread, keeping the UI responsive during VS shutdown
- **Performance: Non-blocking provider menu switching**: All 8 provider menu click handlers converted from blocking `JoinableTaskFactory.Run` to `async void`, preventing UI freezes when switching AI providers
- **Performance: Non-blocking settings menu handlers**: Terminal type, working directory, skip permissions, and Codex full-auto toggle handlers no longer block the UI thread during terminal restart
- **Performance: Non-blocking context menu open**: Provider context menu now uses cached workspace directory instead of synchronous `GetWorkspaceDirectoryAsync` call, eliminating brief hangs on menu open
- **Removed System.Management dependency**: No longer needed after WMI replacement with ToolHelp32

### Version 8.6
- **Fix Windows Terminal commands**: Menu commands (model switch, effort level, usage, set language) now work correctly with Windows Terminal — converted synchronous blocking handlers to async void so focus transfers properly before keyboard simulation
- **Fix Windows Terminal language setting**: Keyboard input for the `/config` TUI (typing "language", arrow keys, space) now uses `keybd_event` instead of `PostMessage` when running in Windows Terminal
- **Terminal lifecycle serialization**: Added semaphore to prevent overlapping terminal start/stop transitions when rapidly switching providers or restarting
- **Improved terminal cleanup**: Uses `WM_CLOSE` + recursive process tree termination instead of simple `Kill`, with safeguards against terminating the VS process itself
- **Non-blocking startup**: Control construction no longer blocks the UI thread for temp directory cleanup or solution events registration
- **Terminal layout stabilization**: Delayed resize/repaint passes after startup and manual Ctrl+Scroll zoom to eliminate stale black regions
- **Codex flag update**: Updated Codex automation flag from `--full-auto` to `--ask-for-approval never` to match current Codex CLI syntax

### Version 8.5
- **Fix terminal zoom tracking**: Replaced WPF PreviewMouseWheel (which never fired for embedded Win32 windows) with a low-level mouse hook that reliably detects Ctrl+Scroll over the terminal, so TerminalZoomDelta is now correctly tracked and replayed on restart
- **Fix Windows Terminal paste**: Changed paste mechanism from right-click (which opens a context menu in WT, causing random text selection) to Ctrl+Shift+V keyboard shortcut, which always pastes reliably
- **Fix Windows Terminal text selection**: Right-click is no longer used for paste in WT, freeing it for the user's normal copy/paste/selection operations

### Version 8.4
- **Detach Terminal - Auto-expand prompt**: On detach, the prompt area automatically grows 80px for more comfortable editing; restores to original size on re-attach
- **Terminal zoom persistence**: Ctrl+Scroll zoom on the terminal is tracked as a delta and replayed via WM_MOUSEWHEEL on every restart, preserving the preferred zoom level across sessions (works for both Command Prompt and Windows Terminal)
- **Prompt font size persistence**: Ctrl+Scroll on the prompt text box adjusts font size and persists across sessions; uses VS default when not explicitly set
- **Detached state persistence fix**: Auto-restore of detached terminal now works when opening any solution, not just when VS starts with a solution already open

### Version 8.3
- **Detach Terminal - Splitter resize**: When terminal is detached, the GridSplitter stays visible so the prompt area can be resized freely
- **Prompt font zoom**: Ctrl+Scroll on the prompt text box increases or decreases the font size (range 8–24pt, persisted across sessions)
- **Detach Terminal fix**: Fixed SplitterPosition being corrupted when SaveSettings was called while the grid was in collapsed state during detach

### Version 8.2
- **Detach Terminal fix**: Terminal now properly fills the entire detached tab (show window first, then re-parent with delayed resize retries)
- **Detach Terminal fix**: Re-attach layout fully restored (layout restored before re-parent so panel has dimensions; delayed resize retries)
- **Detach Terminal fix**: Fixed double re-attach when closing detached tab (Closed event fired twice; added guard + single event source)
- **Detach Terminal fix**: Fixed prompt not being sent when diff changes view is open and terminal is detached
- **Detach Terminal fix**: Prompt area now properly expands to fill all available space when terminal is detached

### Version 8.0
- **Detach Terminal**: New ability to detach the embedded terminal into a separate VS tool window tab via a detach button below the Update button
- When detached, the prompt area expands to fill the available space
- Closing the detached tab automatically re-attaches the terminal to the main panel
- Detached/attached state persists across Visual Studio sessions
- Terminal restart and provider switching work seamlessly while detached
- Theme changes are reflected in the detached terminal window

### Version 7.8
- **Fixed Show Usage for Windows Terminal**: Simplified Show Usage to use `/usage` command directly instead of navigating `/config` menu with keyboard simulation
- **Adjusted Windows Terminal zoom level**: Reduced initial zoom out from 4 to 3 steps for better readability

### Version 7.7
- **Added Windows Terminal support**: Added configurable terminal type selection (Command Prompt vs Windows Terminal) via new "Set Terminal Type..." menu option
- **Windows Terminal integration**: Seamlessly embeds Windows Terminal window into the extension panel using `SetParent` Win32 interop, with DPI-aware tab bar positioning
- **Better emoji and Unicode rendering**: Windows Terminal offers superior rendering of emojis, box-drawing characters, and Unicode symbols compared to Command Prompt
- **Automatic Windows Terminal detection**: Extension detects Windows Terminal availability and provides installation links if not found (Microsoft Store or GitHub)

### Version 7.6
- **Fixed Show Usage menu shortcut**: Updated navigation to use Up arrow then tab for selecting the usage option in `/config`, matching the current Claude Code CLI menu layout

### Version 7.5 - by adrian-schmidt contribution
- **Set Working Directory dialog now follows VS theme**: The dialog background, text, input fields, and buttons now adapt to Visual Studio's dark or light theme instead of using system defaults

### Version 7.4
- **Prompt history now saves file attachments**: When a prompt is sent with attached files, the file paths are stored in the history entry. Navigating history with Ctrl+Up/Down automatically restores files that still exist on disk

### Version 7.3
- **Fixed special characters not rendering properly (Issue #17)**: Added `chcp 65001` (UTF-8), `VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_LEVEL=1` environment variable, and automatic console font change to "Cascadia Mono" (via `SetCurrentConsoleFontEx` Win32 API) for full Unicode glyph support including block elements and box-drawing characters used by AI providers
- **Fixed extension not working properly with some prompts (Issue #20)**: The Virtual Terminal Processing, UTF-8 encoding, and font fixes resolve display corruption and unexpected output that occurred when AI providers used ANSI styling codes and Unicode characters
- **Fixed diff viewer not detecting git changes**: Fixed bug where the diff viewer showed "No changes detected" when `git` command failed (not in PATH, timeout, etc.) — previously treated identically to "no changes". Now git failures preserve existing tracker state instead of clearing it
- **Added VS bundled git fallback**: The diff viewer now automatically finds Visual Studio's bundled git when `git` is not in the system PATH, using VS installation paths and `vswhere.exe`
- **Fixed clipboard contention error**: Added automatic retry logic (up to 10 attempts with 100ms delay) for all clipboard operations to handle `CLIPBRD_E_CANT_OPEN` errors that occur when another application holds the clipboard open

### Version 7.2
- **Added Effort Level Selection**: Added effort level options (Auto, Low, Medium, High, Max) to the Model Selection menu, sends `/effort <level>` to Claude Code, setting is persisted across sessions
- **Added Show Usage**: Sends `/config` and navigates to usage display via automated keystrokes
- **Added Set Language**: Sends `/config` and navigates to language selection via automated keystrokes

### Version 7.1
- **Added Codex Full Auto Toggle**: Added `Codex: Full Auto` option to the Code Agent Selection menu (⚙)
  - Starts Codex (Windows and WSL) with `--full-auto` when enabled
  - Setting is persisted in local JSON settings and restored in the next session
  - Changing this option now reloads Codex automatically so the new startup flag applies immediately

### Version 7.0
- **Added Codex Windows native support**: Added Codex as a Windows native provider (running directly on Windows via npm), renamed previous WSL-only Codex to "Codex (WSL)" in the menu

### Version 6.8
- **Fixed 'too many arguments' error when workspace path contains spaces (Issue #11)**: WSL-based providers (Codex, Claude Code WSL, Cursor Agent WSL) now properly quote the workspace path in `cd` commands, preventing bash errors when the solution directory contains spaces

### Version 6.7 - updated documentation

### Version 6.6 - by fooberichu150 contribution

- **Fixed Terminal Embedding Without Requiring Windows Console Host**: The extension now launches `conhost.exe` explicitly (with `-- cmd.exe ...`), bypassing the Windows Terminal delegation mechanism
- Users no longer need to set "Windows Console Host" as their default terminal — Windows Terminal remains the default for all other applications including debug sessions
- Added `FindMainWindowHandleByConhostAsync` which searches both the conhost PID and its cmd.exe child PID via WMI to reliably find the embedded window handle regardless of Windows backward-compatibility behavior
- **Fixed Terminal Embedding on Fresh VS Launch / Solution Change**: Replaced WMI-based child process lookup with ToolHelp32 kernel snapshot API (`CreateToolhelp32Snapshot`) for finding the cmd.exe child PID under conhost.exe
- The WMI one-shot query at T+200ms was too early on busy systems, causing `FindMainWindowHandleByConhostAsync` to return `IntPtr.Zero` and the terminal to open as a floating external window instead of being embedded
- ToolHelp32 is sub-millisecond and retried on every poll iteration, reliably finding the child PID regardless of system load
- **Fixed Workspace Change for All Providers**: `OnWorkspaceDirectoryChangedAsync` now correctly handles `CursorAgentNative`, `QwenCode`, and `OpenCode` provider availability checks and install instructions on solution open/change
